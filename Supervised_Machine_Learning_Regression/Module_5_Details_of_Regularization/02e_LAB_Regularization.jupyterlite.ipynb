The way that we want to do this is to have you work using NumPy in order to recreate the standardization on your own. The hints that we add here is that if you had your array, which is now going to be two rows and three columns, we can call a.mean, and if we specify an axis, we can get the mean value across either all of the columns or all of the rows. Because we are trying to standardize each column, we obviously want to be working with the mean across all of the columns, we also want to be getting the standard deviation across each one of the columns, and then we can subtract the mean using this.mean method that's available for a NumPy arrays as well as the.std method, which is available with NumPy arrays as well."

So looking back to the hint, we'd be essentially subtracting each one of our different mean values for that column, and then dividing by the standard deviation for that column. That should be all that your standard scaler should be doing under the hood. We're then going to check that the solution of this will end up being equal to one another. X_ss being this standard scaled version of our original dataframe that we have above using the standard scaler and man_transform is our new array where we created that manual transformation of the standard scaler on our own. The np.allclose is just telling us that every single value in two arrays are very similar to one another. By very similar, we mean that there may be under the hood some type of small difference due to just rounding error. So it would be something like the tenth decimal point can be difference and that's what the numpy.allclose. That'll be useful as we use different means of coming up with the same solution and trying to ensure that they are all the same values, all of the outcomes of the same values.

But in regards to figuring out which one of these different coefficients has the largest effect on the outcome of our median value, which one's the most important feature?

So we see here that LSTAT, which is just lower status of the area is associated with the very lowest number and RM, which stands for the number of rooms, is associated with the highest coefficient, which makes sense. The more rooms we have, the higher our median value for our household would be, and the lower the status of the surrounding area, the lower median value of our household would be.
